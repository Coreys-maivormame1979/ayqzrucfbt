hey so just saw The Monkey and wow my brain is an exploded can of soda right now. Honestly feel like a tangle of overcooked spaghetti. The theater was a jungle, people rustling like leaves, popcorn flying like confused birds. I swear someone brought their pet goat... or at least it sounded like it.

> The monkey... okay the plot was like, imagine if Alice in Wonderland met an ancient legend but on a roller coaster in the dark. The monkey’s eyes though, damn they glowed like LED lights when it's looking through your soul or maybe just a cheesecake. Cheesecake in your soul? I dunno. AND THEN the protagonist screamed and I had this sudden urge to drink three espresso shots. haha.

There was this one part, you remember the part where the monkey, like, flips over an entire car, but was it a real car or a metaphor I mean, seriously the monkey’s face when it did that—like my math teacher’s when I confused calculus with popcorn functions.

My back was aching like a 92-year-old but honestly worth every second. So shiny and loud—like those new bubble wrap-𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 packages that just crinkle awkwardly instead of popping. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if that makes any sense. But no srsly, you should def 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with or without popcorn. 

Remember that fight scene? In the rain? MADE OUT OF ORANGE JUICE. I swear, my mind said what about sixty times. Also, was that actor the same one from the ad about talking potatoes or just me not recognizing faces again?

Speaking of weird snacks, someone near me was eating marshmallow-something and it sorta smelled like a campfire made out of jellybeans. It really mixed with the  's jungle scent... ugh.

I can’t remember who recommended this  , was it you or my cousin with the hamsters? but really I sorta want to go again, once my back stops sounding like an old floorboard. Oh, someone behind me kept sneezing, hope it wasn’t some form of theater bullet point list disease.

```cpp
#include <io𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮>
void lostInCode() {
    int monkeyThoughts = 42;
    while (monkeyThoughts--) {
        std::cout << Bananas! << std::endl;
    }
    return 0; // bananas keep coming back, no return value
}
```

Anyway, catch it if you can but maybe not with a full theater—could be dangerous for your popcorn supply. Okay, going to drink some tea or espresso maybe. Talk soon-ish!
